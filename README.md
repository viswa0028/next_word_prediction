# Next Word Prediction Project

## Overview
This project implements a Next Word Prediction model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning. The goal is to predict the most likely next word in a given sentence or phrase based on the context provided. This project can be extended for applications like autocomplete, text suggestion, and intelligent writing assistants.

## Features
- Preprocessing of textual data (cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization)
- Training a language model using deep learning techniques
- Predicting the next word with high accuracy
- Interactive interface for testing predictions


## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
- NumPy and Pandas
- Colab

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/next-word-prediction.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd next-word-prediction
```

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset and preprocess it.
2. Train the language model.
3. Use the interactive script to input a sentence and predict the next word.

Example:
```python
from predictor import predict_next_word

sentence = "The weather is really"
predicted_word = predict_next_word(sentence)
print(f"Predicted next word: {predicted_word}")
```

## Results
The model achieves high accuracy on common benchmark datasets and performs well on real-world text inputs.

## Future Enhancements
- Support for multiple languages
- Integration with transformer-based models
- Improved user interface for real-time prediction
